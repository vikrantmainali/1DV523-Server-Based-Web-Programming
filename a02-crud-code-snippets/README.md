# A02 CRUD Code Snippets

1. Describe the architecture of your application. How have you structured your code and what are your thoughts behind the architecture?
- The application is written in Node.js with Express framework and mongoose object modeling. The application uses MVC Architecture and is split up into Models, Views, Controllers, Routes and the Persistence. After the user submits a request, it is routed to appropriate controller which then interacts with the data model and invokes the result view. This is then rendered back to the user.

2. How was it to work with persistant data in this assignment, can you relate to other databases you might have learned before?
- Learning to use persistant data was a major part of the assignment and it reminded me of using MySQL. Although it was a little tricky to get started at first, it was quiteeasy to get the hang of it as I was learning and developing the snippet application.

3. Are you satsified with your application? Does it have some improvement areas? What are you especially satisfied with?
- I am satisfied with how the application has turned out but there are definitely improvement areas. The views and the CSS is one of the major improvement areas but there are also a few minor code edits that are needed to make the code cleaner. The part that I am satisfied with the most is how I've used the MVC architecture. 

4. What is your TIL for this course part?
- The biggest takeaway for me from this assignment is using the Express framework and using the MVC architecture.
